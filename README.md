# Aarogya

We have developed A mobile application as well as a website built using MIT app inventor and Website Framework that notifies patients of nearby hospitals. It provides the hospital as well as ambulances with critical information such as the patientâ€™s location and enables effective GPS route management via real time traffic information on scheduled routes. By this application you can track the nearby ambulances in emergency situation as well as book them. If you want more information about the ambulance and driver , You can track them using the application AAROGYA.
